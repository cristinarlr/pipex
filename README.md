# pipex
The goal of this project is to implement a simplified version of the shell pipeline functionality found in Unix-based operating systems.
In Unix-like systems, a pipeline allows the output of one command to be used as the input to another command. 
For example, the command command1 | command2 takes the output of command1 and uses it as the input for command2.
